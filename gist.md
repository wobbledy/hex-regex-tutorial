# Matching Hex Values with Regex

Regular expressions (or regex for short) are useful for matching patterns within strings. The regular expression being used here is intended to match the hexidecimal (or hex for short) value within a string. Hexadecimals are simply a base 16 number system that allows values from 0 to F.

## Summary

This tutorial will go over the components of the regex being used here. The hex regex is useful in matching color codes within a string. The tutorial will cover the topics of Anchors, Quantifiers, Grouping Constructs, Bracket Expressions, Character Classes, The OR Operator, Flags, and Chaaracter Escapes. The Regex is below:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
